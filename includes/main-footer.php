  <h3>Dedicated to the fun of the game since 2008</h3>

  <p>We first started organizing soccer games in NYC back in 2008. Since then, we've grown to 8,000+ members. Our focus has always been on the fun of the game. We hope our members get more than excercise: we hope they return because of the great community we've fostered.</p>
