<p class="lead">Maintaining vertical rhythm (or composing to a baseline grid) is the practice of making sure that the height of each textual element on the page (including lists, headings and block quotes) is divisible by a common number. This common number (the single beat in a series of musical bars, if you will) is typically derived from the height of one paragraph line. You should be able to see by now why an impossible value like 26.5 pixels would be a mistake for such an integral measure.</p>
<p>The benefits of vertical rhythm to readability are much subtler than those of hinting, measure or leading, but they are still important. Vertical rhythm gives the page decorum. Because we have made sure so far that all of our measurements are co-dependent and relative, altering the font size for the body (all the way up at the top of the cascade) will not damage the pageâ€™s vertical rhythm.</p>

<h2>This is an h2</h2>
<p>It is worth noting that, although a line height of 1.5 is fairly dependable, not all fonts are made equal. Fonts with a tall x-height or long descenders might benefit from more generous, separative leading. When basic readability is at stake, adopting a more complex vertical rhythm algorithm is worth it.</p>
